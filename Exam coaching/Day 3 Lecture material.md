Dealing with 2-dim sample spaces
- The $^2$ is easy to miss
- Example with 2 dim space
	- Discrete and continuous

Talk about measure integrals again:
- For discrete and continuous with Lebesgue with continuous and differentiable functions
- Riemann -> Lebesgue
- Expected value
- Visualize the Lebesgue measure, what is it doing on $\mathbb{R}^2$
- Avoid a riemann integral if you can
	- If you know the density
Lebesgue measure -> proof how it measures points at zero
dirac measure

Stochastic independence
- Finding sets -> do some exercises with the dirac measure

# Decision theory
- Before we covered individual rules and now it's going to be how rule relate to one another
- What is R-better and R-incomparable
- What is completeness
- What is minimally completeness?
- How does it relate to risk points
- How do you prove that something is minimally complete
- How do you disprove that something is minimally complete
- Visualize some convex and concave shapes and see where
