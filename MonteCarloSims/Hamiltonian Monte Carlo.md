#montecarlo 
## Problem that is solved
- doesn't break down to high dimensions
- Holistic approach, take large steps in the "right" direction, that won't get rejected

## Hamiltonian physics
- Find the momentum to find the direction
- Every position is characterized by position $p$ and momentum $q$
- You
