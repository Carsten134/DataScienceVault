Let $M$ be a [[Closed subspace]] of a [[Hilbert Space]] $H$ and let $x\in H$. Then there exists a unique element $\hat{x}= P_{M}x$ such that:
1. $\lvert x-\hat{x} \rvert = \inf_{y\in M}\lvert y-x \rvert$
2. $\langle x-\hat{x},y \rangle =0 \hspace{1em} \forall y\in M$

The projection theorem guarantees, that there is a best linear estimator for every $x\in H$ and that this solution (or estimator) is orthogonal to every element of the closed subspace $M$.
