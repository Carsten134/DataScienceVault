A [[Time Series]] $X_{t}$ is weakly stationary iff the mean and autocovariance is timeinvariant. That is:
1. $\mathbb{E}(X_{t}) = \mu$
2. $Cov(X_{t}, X_{t-h})=\gamma(h)$
This way this property is strongly connected to the [[ACF]], the [[Empirical autocovariance function]] and the [[Theoretical autocovariance function]].
