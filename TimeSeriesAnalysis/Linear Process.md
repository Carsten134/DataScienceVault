A [[Time Series]] $Y_{t}$ is a linear process if it can be expressed as a linear combination of [[White noise]]:
$$
Y_{t} = \sum_{j\in \mathbb{Z}} \psi_{j}\varepsilon_{t-j}
$$
With $\sum_{j\in \mathbb{Z}}|\psi_{j}|<\infty$
We can also think about it like a [[Linear filter]] $\psi$, that is applied to white noise.
