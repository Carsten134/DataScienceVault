Let $\varepsilon_{t}$ be a [[Time Series]], uncorrelated and identically distributed. Also let:
$$
\mathbb{E}(\varepsilon_{t}) = 0\hspace{1em} Var(\varepsilon_{t}) = \sigma^2
$$
Then we call $\varepsilon_{t}$ white noise notated with $WN(0,\sigma^2)$. 

## strong and weak white noise
White noise is either **weak**, if it is uncorrelated or **strong**, if it is independent.

## Why "white noise"?
The [[spectrum]] is = 1 for all frequencies, like white light:
