We can scale the [[Base Frequency]] with $2\pi$ and get **radial frequencies**:
$$
\omega_{k} = 2\pi \lambda_{k}
$$
These are especially useful when in relation to the [[Fourier Series]] because now the approximation can be expressed as a superposition of waves that have the length $\omega_{k}$:
$$
y_{t}=\sum_{k=0}^{\frac T 2} a_{k}\cos(\omega_{k}t)+b_{k}\sin(\omega_{k}t)
$$
The Angular frequency is measured in radians
