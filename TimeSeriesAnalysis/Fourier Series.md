Is used to move from the time domain to the frequency domain and is an approximate of a given [[Time Series]] using trigonometric functions:
$$
y_{t} = \sum_{k=0}^\infty \left[ a_{k} \cos \left( 2\pi \frac kT t \right)+b_{k} \sin \left( 2\pi \frac kT t \right)   \right] 
$$
We can therefore express the time series as a superposition of different waves at different [[Base Frequency]].
