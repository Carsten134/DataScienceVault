Let $W$ be a [[Linear filter]] and $p_{W}(z)$ be it's [[characteristic polynomial]]. Then it holds that:
$$
p_{W}(\lambda)=0\Longleftrightarrow \{\lambda^{-t}\}_{t\in \mathbb{Z}}\in Ker(W)
$$
So there is a connection between the roots of a characteristic polynomial and it's [[Kernel of a linear filter]]. 
Also if $\lambda$ is of multiplicity of $r$ it holds that:
$$
\{\lambda^{-t}t^i\}_{t\in \mathbb{Z}}\in Ker(W)\hspace{1em} \forall i \in \{0,\dots,r-1\}
$$
