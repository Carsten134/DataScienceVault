#analysis 
Let some [[mapping]] $f:\mathbb{C}\to \mathbb{C}$ and a point $c\in \mathbb{C}$. Then we can show that, there is a [[sequence]] $a_{n}$ such that:
$$
f(z) = \sum_{n=-\infty}^\infty a_{n}(z-c)^n
$$
The [[Taylor Approximation]] is a special case of the Laurent series.
# convergence
A Laurent series behaves convergent around an [[annulus]] of $c$ and is **unique once it exits!**
