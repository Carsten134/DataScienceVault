Let $f(x)$ be a continuous and differentiable function $f: \mathbb{R}\to \mathbb{R}$. Then we can approximate $f$ with some development point $x_{0}\in \mathbb{R}$:
$$
f(x) \approx \sum_{k=0}^T \frac{f^{(k)}(x_{0})}{k!}(x-x_{0})^k
$$
This is useful because now we can express every function that is continuous and differentiable as a polynomial of order $T$.
