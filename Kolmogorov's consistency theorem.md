Let $F_{T}$ be a collection of [[Finite-dimensional distribution for timeseries]]. Then they fully specify the stochastic process [[Time Series]], iff:
$$
F_{t_{1},\dots,t_{k}, t_{k+1}}(y_{1},\dots,y_{k}, y_{k+1}) \to F_{t_{1}, \dots,t_{k}}(y_{1},\dots,y_{k}) 
$$
if $y_{k+1}\to \infty$.

But only if $\mathbb I$, the indexset is countable and has a linear order.
