An eigentvalue of a [[Linear filter]] $W$ is given by the property:
$$
W(y_{t}) = \lambda y_{t}
$$
For a given realized [[Time Series]] $y_{t}$
We can notate the space of all vectors that fulfill this condition as a [[Basis]]:
$$
\mathcal B_{\lambda} = \{y_{t} \in \mathbb{C}^\mathbb{Z}: W(y_{t}) = \lambda y_{t}\}
$$
Like wise we call the special cases $\mathcal B_{0}$ the [[Kernel of a linear filter]] and $\mathcal B_{1}$ the [[Invariance set of a linear filter]] of $W$.
$$
\begin{align}
\mathcal B_{0} &= Ker(W) \\
\mathcal B_{1} &= Inv(W)
\end{align}
