## weak law of large numbers
Let $X_{n}$ be a sequence of [[Random Variable]]s, [[stochastical independence]] with $\mathbb{E}(X_{n})=\mu<\infty$ as well as $\mathbb{E}((X_{n}-\mu)^2)<\infty$. Then the sample average converges to the $\mu$ in probability ([[Convergence in probability ]]). 

## strong law of large numbers
Same assumptions lead to [[almost sure convergence]].
