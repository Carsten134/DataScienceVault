Let some true value for a parameter $\theta$ and some [[estimator]] for this parameter $\hat{\theta}$. Then we can express the [[MSE]] of this estimator as an addition of the bias and variance:
$$
MSE(\theta,\hat{\theta}) = BIAS(\hat{\theta})^2+Var(\hat{\theta})
$$
So the only contributions to the $MSE$ are given by the bias and the variance of $\hat{\theta}$.
